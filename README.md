### Description: 

> “Austin B-cycle is public bike share system that rolled in to Austin in December 2013. The system is owned by the City of Austin and operated by the local 501c3  > non-profit Bike Share of Austin. Austin B-cycle immediately broke national records for check outs during SXSW—making it one of the most successful bike-sharing > programs in the country. Currently there are 76 B-cycle stations around downtown Austin”- [Austin B-Cycle](https://austinbcycle.com/)
> We are analyzing the bike sharing data from the Austin B-Cycle company within a  5 year span (2013-Present). The analysis seeks to draw trends related to the demand >of the service, and also use the historical price data by membership to understand which price point has the highest profitability". 
> 
> * The first part of the analysis will look at the demand by station, membership, season, year, month, and hour. 
> * The second part will take the historical pricing data provided by Austin B-Cycle company and show profitability by membership type, station, season, year, month, > hour. 
> * The last part will look at the unique and temporary Austin population peeks such as SXSW, ACL for all 5 years, and Uber Ban for (May 9, 2016 - May 29, 2017).  


### Purpose: 

This analysis helps the enterprise to increase the profit by increasing the availability of the bikes at the most popular stations during the most popular times. This would help the company determine when the best time is to make bike repairs, when to order new bicycles,  and when to store extra backup bicycles. 
This also helps the customers to select the most price worthy membership.
