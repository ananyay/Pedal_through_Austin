### Description: 

> “Austin B-cycle is public bike share system that rolled in to Austin in December 2013. The system is owned by the City of Austin and operated by the local 501c3 non-profit Bike Share of Austin. Austin B-cycle immediately broke national records for check outs during SXSW—making it one of the most successful bike-sharing programs in the country. Currently there are 76 B-cycle stations around downtown Austin”- Austin B-Cycle 

> We are analyzing the bike sharing data from the Austin B-Cycle company within a 5 year span (2013-Present). The analysis seeks to draw trends related to the demand of the service.
> 
> * The first part of the analysis will look at the demand by station, membership, year, month, and hour.
> * The last part will look at the unique and temporary Austin population peeks such as SXSW and ACL for all 5 years, and Uber Ban for (May 9, 2016 - May 29, 2017).
 
### Purpose: 

This analysis helps the enterprise to increase the profit by increasing the availability of the bikes at the most popular stations during the most popular times. This would help the company determine when the best time is to make bike repairs, when to order new bicycles, and when to store extra backup bicycles. 

### Scope: 

* We only have the data for the Austin B-Cycle company
* Data is only from December, 2013 through July, 2018

### Data Set: 

* [Austin B-Cycle bicycle sharing program API] (https://data.austintexas.gov/resource/cwi3-ckqi.json)

### Analysis Objectives: 

1. Is there any variation in the usage over 5 years?

2. Are there any factors that promote the usage of bikes ?

3. Why does the B-Cycle website not include all the membership types available in the data?

4. What benefit would the analysis provide to both the users and Austin B-cycle?

5. How long is a trip on an average and where do the trips usually start from? 

### Actions and Tasks: 

* Obtaining all the data from Austin B Cycle Company
* Data Cleaning and Exploration
* Chart Plotting
* Writing Analysis

### Conclusions: 

* We found that bike usage increases consistently throughout the years and that March and October are the top two months with the most bike rentals. This is due to SXSW and ACL festivals.
* There is more usage of bikes on weekends compared to weekdays.
* Saturday has the most bicycle rentals and 2:00pm to 5:00 pm are the busiest hours on any day of the week. 
* The top station is 21st and Speedway.
* The most popular membership type is “walk up” with the longest average trip duration of 41 minutes.
* The 18 month U.T. pilot program for free student bike rentals started in 2018, and is very popular.
* Total bike rides during Uber Ban were higher except for 2018, which was affected by the U.T. students free bike rentals.
