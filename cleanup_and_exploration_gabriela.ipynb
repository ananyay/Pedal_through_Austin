    "This notebook contains the clean up and exploration for the publically available data of Austin B-Cycle, a bikesharing program. The notebook looks at the inconsistencies in the columns caused by missing data, duplicates, typos and other anomalies. The result is an re-organized CSV file that has data ready for analysis. \n",

    "\n",
    "* The Austin B-Cycle data comes from the city of Austin Open Data Portal(AODP). The portal has API functionality through which we obtained the most current dataset. The API uses The Socrata Open Data API(SODA API) which hosts the AODP datasets. \n",

    "* As of early September 2018, there are a total of 991271 rows of rides. The dataset starts since Austin B-Cycle inception in December 2013 through July 2018. \n",
